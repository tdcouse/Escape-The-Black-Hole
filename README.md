# Escape The Black Hole
 This is a game created in Python by Dante Almeida, Trent Couse, and Ken Woempner as a part of our PY251 Final Project.

In order to run this game you will need the modules:
numpy
matplotlib
IPython
time
scipy

If you want to run this game with sound you will these two modules.
pyaudio*
pysine*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to play the game, all you need to do is clone the repository and open the "Escape The Black Hole.ipynb" file.
Once you have this file open, if you run the first cell, you can play the game.
***Warning: If you you try to rerun the cell without completing the game, it will break and you will need to restart the kernal to play the game.

If you are running the games without the pyaudio or pysine modules, you can not play with sound. You will need to add sound=False as in input to the game function.
This will allow you to play the game without sound and you will no longer need those two modules.

If you are interested in how our game works, look at the file "The_Game.py" - this is the file we used to run the entire game.
We produced all the gif's ourselves and how we did that can be seen in the "all_gifs.ipynb" file. We then used a gif editor to compress many of these gifs so they would load faster.
